# Vue.js and Cesium POC Project

This is a proof of concept (POC) project that demonstrates the integration of Vue.js with Cesium, a 3D mapping and geospatial visualization library. The project uses Vite as the build tool and TypeScript for type safety.

## Features

- **Vue.js 3**: A progressive framework for building user interfaces.
- **Cesium**: A JavaScript library for creating 3D globes and maps.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
